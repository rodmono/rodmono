     		I am currently the Head Quant at <a href="https://ratio.finance/">Ratio Finance</a>, a collateralized debt position protocol in the Solana Blockchain. I was previously working for the Emerging Markets Desk as XVA Trader and Front Office Quant at <a href="https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/en.html">Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets</a>. I started my carrer in finance at <a href="https://gbm.com/">Grupo Bursatil Mexicano</a> where I learned, created and implemented quantitative trading strategies for the futures and equities markets

     		I got involved with cryptoassets in 2017 and I decided to go all-in in 2022. I am mainly interested in developing data-driven quantitive solutions for investor portfolio creation and financial risk management. I enjoy bridging the gap between theoretical research and real-world financial applications attempting to add some value to the industry.
