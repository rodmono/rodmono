<div style="text-align:justify;font-size:14px;">
		I am a Senior Quantitative Analyst with over 7 years of experience in the financial industry. I have worked in Hedge Funds, Banks, and a couple of DeFi companies, covering a wide range of topics such as risk management, derivative pricing and valuation, as well as FI/FX trading.
		<br>
		<br>
Throughout my career, the prevailing theme has been the design, implementation, and documentation of financial solutions, all of which have capitalized on my programming skills and technical expertise. I have been involved in projects of various sizes and complexities, where I had the opportunity to collaborate and support teams from diverse backgrounds and business areas.
