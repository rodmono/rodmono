### About

		I work at <a href="https://blockanalitica.com/">Block Analitica</a> as a Researcher and Risk Analyst. The main focus of my work is Counterparty Credit Risk and Market Risk. Previously I worked for other crypto projects, notably <a href="https://ratio.finance/">Ratio Finance</a>, a collateralized debt position protocol in the Solana Blockchain. I also worked in Traditional Finance at <a href="https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/en.html">Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets</a> for the Emerging Markets Desk as XVA Trader and Front Office Quant. I started my career in Finance at <a href="https://gbm.com/">Grupo Bursatil Mexicano</a> where I learned, created and implemented quantitative trading strategies for futures and equities.

		I got involved with cryptoassets in 2017 and I decided to go all-in at the end of 2021. I am mainly interested in developing data-driven quantitive solutions for investor portfolio creation and financial risk management. I enjoy bridging the gap between theoretical research and real-world financial applications attempting to add some value to the industry.
